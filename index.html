      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my first webpage! I'm creating this as part of my coursework for the UCF Full Stack Bootcamp.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Brevard County, FL, but have spent my share of time in various parts of the country</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I spend most of my spare time cooking. I work as a bartender and love the social aspect of the job so much 
        that it barely feels like work sometimes.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I picture myself as a full stack developer or project manager. My goal is to travel the country with my girlfriend
        and kitty in trailer; Whenever we get somewhere we'd like to stay for a bit, I want to hop behind a bar as I please.
        .</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web developing would help me to build my personal brand. I fancy myself as something of a "Renaissance Man." I have
        several interests in life and all of them are centered around being creative; I'm hoping I can obtain the skills I 
        would need to turn my passions into a money-making reality.
